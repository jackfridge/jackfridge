# ✨ Welcome to my Github profile page! ✨ 
### Hi, I’m @jackfridge :wave:
I very recently made the jump from medical school to starting my professional journey as a software developer.
Certainly one of the more difficult decision I've had to make, but I'm more than excited to explore this incredible career path.

I'm a lifelong learner and my love of learning definitely doesn't stop at programming and technology.
Be it music, the chemistry of cooking, gardening and permaculture, meditation, or gaming, 
there is always something new and amazing to learn and further expand my knowledge.
My background in medicine has helped me tremendously in establishing a solid foundation 
for being able to self-teach effectively and I will no doubt apply these skills to keep learning
and improve as a developer.
