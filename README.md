# ✨ Welcome to my Github profile page! ✨ 
### Hi, I’m @jackfridge :wave:
I very recently made the jump from medical school to starting my professional journey as a software developer.
Certainly one of the more difficult decision I've had to make, but I'm more than excited to explore this incredible career path.

I'm a lifelong learner and my love of learning definitely doesn't stop at programming and technology.
Be it music, the chemistry of cooking, gardening and permaculture, meditation, or gaming, 
there is always something new and amazing to learn and further expand my knowledge on these subjects.
My background in medicine has helped me tremendously in establishing a solid foundation 
for being able to self-teach effectively and I will no doubt apply these skills to keep learning
and improve as a developer.

I'm a CS50 graduate, Harvard's free online course "Introduction to computer science and programming".
This course taught me the basics of logic in C, as well as basics of web programming with HTML/CSS, 
Javascript, SQL and Python through the use of the Flask framework to create simple web pages and
interactive web apps. Most importantly though, CS50 taught me how to think like a programmer.
This course will always be special to me, because after three years of not knowing if medical 
school was the right decision, it barely took a week of CS50 to convince me that software development
was the career path for me. I've been through many "back-and-forth" decisions on what I want to do 
with my life, but it's a nice feeling to have finally found it.
