# ✨ Welcome to my Github profile page! ✨ 
### Hi, I’m @jackfridge :wave:
I'm an ex-medical student who transitionned into the tech industry after realizing that technology is without a doubt the better fit for me.

Learning is my biggest motivator when it comes to any goal I set for myself and I believe curiosity and thirst for knowledge are the two things that make me who I am today.
